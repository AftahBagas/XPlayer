#### ‚ùì FAQ :

Q. Lag During Music Playback

> Completely depends on your machine, (may lag on Heroku free dynos) as pytgcalls have high CPU usage.

#### üêû Bugs :

Joined Voice Chat but doesn't play anything.

> It's a common pytgcalls issue.
> possible workaround -> use [`üêû Debug`] button

#### ‚ö°Ô∏è Upcoming :

**Note** : no ETA (Delayed until pytgcalls gets stable)

- Recorder
- UI tweaks
- Inline Support for `.managevc` so no need to add bot in group

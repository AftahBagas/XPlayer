# X-PLAYER

**Voice Chat Music and Radio Player for X**

## üìå NOTE :

1. Never ever join an active voice chat with the same account. (**System will hang**)
2. To Listen to music in Voice chat best way is to use **USERGE-X** in your **alt account** and add all XPlayer commands in sudo (avoid using Multiple owner IDs) and for **interactive buttons** (`.managevc`) add your bot in group.

### üåü Features :

- Multiple Chat support.
- Text based integrated youtube search.
- Quick Toggles for volume up-down, mute-unmute etc.
- A traditional user friendly player packed with Resume, Pause, Repeat, Shuffle, Skip !
- Beta play from radio station streamable links. (see help `.radio`)
- Auto Song Download and Clean (No need to worry about storage)
- Supports music playback from :

```
1. Text (integrated youtube search)
2. Song URL (Spotify, YouTube, Deezer, Amazon music etc.)
3. Telegram audio / media group and *channels
```

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation :

**Requirements**-

- USERGE-X `v0.5.1` or above.

#### ‚ö°Ô∏èFAQ :

Q. Lag During Music Playback

> Completely depends on your machine, (may lag on Heroku free dynos) as pytgcalls have high CPU usage.

#### üêû Bugs :

Joined Voice Chat but doesn't play anything.

> It's a common pytgcalls issue, possible workaround -> Press Stop button, then Debug button and Join again. (works sometime)

#### üòÅ Upcoming :

**Note** : no ETA

- Recorder
- UI tweaks
